Note: The file transmission-daemon_SMF.tar.gz is just all of these files
in a tarball.

Note: This is just something I threw together quickly so it's not the
prettiest thing around.

# Installation

Installation is simple, just run:

# ./install_smf

and you are done.  The script takes no arguments.

For now it just installs into /lib/svc and /var/svc.  Maybe one day I'll
re-write the install_smf script to be able to install into an alternate
location.
